        <p>Amazon will spend up to $5 billion on a second HQ in North America, intended to operate as a "full equal" to its Seattle base and house up to 50,000 employees. The company has sent out the call to local and state governments for pitches.Winning
          the bid would have a major impact on the region’s economy.</p>
        <p>Amazon has promised to bring the city tens of thousands of "high-paying" jobs and billions of dollars in investments. There’s no denying the e-commerce giant’s effect on Seattle; the city has been called America’s biggest company town, with Amazon
          taking up more office space than the next 40 biggest employers combined.</p>
